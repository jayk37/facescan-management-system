bcryptnodejs: Allows us to create a very secure login. Passwords are never
		     stored as plain text. They are stored as hashes.

		We never send user passwords and emails over the GET request 
		as a query string. We send it in the POST request in the body. 

		The passwords are then stored in the database in a hash and 
		bcrypt allows us to do that.

How to install bcrypt:
	npm install bcrypt-nodejs.



FUNCTIONS USED IN BCRYPT:

	The following functions can be used within the signin and register GET/
	POST request.

	The function given below encrypts your password and returns the hash
	value so that it is secure...
	
	bcrypt.hash("bacon", null, null, function(err, hash) {
    		// Store hash in your password DB.
	});







	The 2 functions below are used to compare if the password entered
	matches the hash value or not.


	// Load hash from your password DB.
	bcrypt.compare("bacon", hash, function(err, res) {
    		// res == true
	});
	bcrypt.compare("veggies", hash, function(err, res) {
    		// res = false
	});
